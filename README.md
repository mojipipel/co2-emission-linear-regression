🚗 CO₂ Emission Prediction using Linear Regression

Author: Mojtaba Pipelzadeh
Domain: Machine Learning | Data Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Simple Linear Regression to analyze and predict CO₂ emissions of vehicles based on their engine size.

The main objective is to showcase a clean, interpretable, and reproducible machine learning workflow using real-world environmental data.
This repository is designed as a portfolio-ready ML project, emphasizing clarity, structure, and best practices.

📊 Dataset

The dataset includes vehicle technical specifications such as:

Engine Size

Fuel Consumption

CO₂ Emissions

Target Variable: CO₂ Emissions
Feature Used: Engine Size

Dataset source is publicly available and commonly used for educational and analytical purposes.

🧠 Methodology

The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

Data loading and exploration

Feature selection and preprocessing
